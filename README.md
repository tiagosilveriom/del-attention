# del-attention

This repository contains the implementation of **Theory of Mind** using **Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL)**. The primary contribution of this work is the integration of **attention modeling** into the framework. This project builds upon the foundational work developed by **Lasse Dissing** and **Thomas Bolander**.

The original repository for their work can be found [here](https://lab.compute.dtu.dk/pepper/del). Please note that it may be inaccessible due to restricted access rights.

## Features
- Dynamic Epistemic Logic for modeling Theory of Mind
- Novel integration of attention mechanisms
- Built on prior work by leading researchers in the field
